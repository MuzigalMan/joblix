Why so, because we are on a mission to empower the individual to realise/unleash their full potential. Following are some of our flagship products:  OpeninApp  Almost all your favourite creators on Instagram share links to their latest YouTube videos or YouTube channels in their bio or stories. But whenever you tap on those links, you get redirected to the YouTube website instead of the YouTube app. And here you can’t watch the video in full screen nor can you like it, comment on it or subscribe to the channel.  Ever wondered why it is so? That’s because Instagram has something called a Built—IN-Browser that opens up instead of opening the app you wanted to open. Which is not cool at all….And this is not just so for IG but for all your favourite social media apps eg. YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, Snapchat, Telegram, Quora etc.  So we fixed this problem of sub-optimal user experiences by building a tool that ensures all social media links open in the apps they should. It’s called OpeninApp. And it is already been loved by over 20,000 influencers & brands including the likes of Munawar Faruqui, Raj Shamani, Riva Arora, Aishwarya (Ranjnikant-ji’s daughter), trakin Tech, Mamaearth etc. And has been used by 55Mn+ users.  Listed.fans  We Listians find it very painful that unlike tech entrepreneurs there’s little to no capital available for our darling social media creators or influencers, the wonderful people who entertain us, educate us and so so much more. And this is not just the case for social media creators but individual performers of any form be they are, cricketers, singers, dancers, actors etc… So, Listed helps rising creators get funded, just like startups by been-there done-that's like mega-influencers, agency owners and brand CXOs to launch and accelerate their own creator-ships. In return, these rising stars pledge to share a portion of their future incomes with their investors for a certain fixed period of time.  So, if you believe the gifted individuals of today will overshadow the companies of yesterday, and in doing so, have the right to capital & guidance, then welcome to the tribe.  So if you are someone who is passionate about social media and wants to improve User Experiences for a Billion+ people, then welcome home…  Who Should apply?  If you are someone who has -  Understanding and hands-on experience with AI/ML Modelling, Libraries, frameworks, and Tools Knowledge of Python, SQL/NoSQL Desire to be hands-on and help invent AI for creators and Influencers Relevant education or certification in AI/ML  Please Apply!
